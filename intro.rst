Introduction: Accessing F5 Distributed Cloud Console
====================================================

Welcome to this F5 Distributed Cloud Lab. The following tasks will guide you through the initial 
access requirements for this multi-part lab.  Lab attendees should have received an invitation 
(which requests you update your password for access) email to the lab environment. Please check 
the email address used for course registration and its associated spam folders to see if the
invitation email has been received.  If you have not received an email, please contact a member
of the lab team.
 
The F5 Distributed Cloud Console, where a majority of all lab tasks will be conducted, is a SaaS
based control-plane for services which provides a GUI and API for managing network, security, and
compute services. The F5 Distributed Cloud Console can manage "sites" in existing on-premises,
private data centers and sites within AWS, Azure, and GCP public cloud environments.

In this lab, we will be demonstrating how to configure the connector for Amazon CloudFront CDN. 
While the majority of the lab will be in the Distibuted Cloud (XC) Console, there will be a short demo 
video on finding and deploying the connector, and uploading the configuration files recently created in 
this lab session.
