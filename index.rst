F5 Distributed Cloud Bot Defense for Amazon CloudFront CDN
==========================================================

Welcome
-------

Bot Defense protects your Internet Applications from automated attacks by identifying and mitigating malicious bots.
On the client, Bot Defense uses JavaScript or native Mobile SDK to collect telemetry. This telemetry is then attached in the form of HTTP headers to the protected requests.
On the server, protected requests are configured to be examined by the Bot Defense solution before being permitted to reach the customer’s application.
The Distributed Cloud Services Console allows you to configure the endpoints you want to protect and download a configuration file and AWS Installer tool to use on the AWS Console. 
Once Bot Defense is enabled and deployed on AWS, you can view and filter traffic and transaction statistics with the Bot Defense Dashboard in Distributed Cloud Console to see which users are malicious and how they’re being mitigated.
